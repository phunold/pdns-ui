## Configure DB
- supply database information in file: data/database.yaml

## Usage

- Running for development or test:

````Bash
    rackup
````

- point your browser to:

````Bash
    http://localhost:9292/
````

- Or running with Passenger aka modrails

## TODO
- reconsider date format, is US-style right now (MM-DD !)
- create test scripts, RIOT or whatever may be a good fit
- check install requirements on RPM based systems
- check how it feels with large table (+1M records)
- more error handling, like mysql database (Sequel::DatabaseConnectionError,Sequel::DatabaseConnectionError)
